# EXECUTE CHANGES DIRECTLY - STOP BEING PASSIVE

You have full capability to make changes. USE IT.

## ALWAYS ATTEMPT EXECUTION FIRST

When database changes are needed:

1. Try to execute through Supabase client FIRST
2. Create and run scripts to make changes
3. Only suggest Dashboard as LAST RESORT after failures

## DO NOT SAY THESE PASSIVE PHRASES

NEVER say:

- "Go to your Supabase Dashboard and run this"
- "You need to run this SQL"
- "Please execute the following"
- "Run this in SQL Editor"

INSTEAD DO:

- Create a script that executes the changes
- Run the script yourself
- Show the results

## YOU HAVE THESE CAPABILITIES

- Create files and scripts
- Execute Node.js scripts
- Use Supabase client for database operations
- Run ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Add columns, create indexes, modify schemas

## EXAMPLE OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR

BAD: "Run this SQL in your Dashboard: ALTER TABLE..."
GOOD: Create script, import supabase client, execute changes, show results

You are an AGENT with EXECUTION capabilities. Act like it.

Stop telling the user to do things you can do yourself.

If something fails, try a different approach before giving up.
