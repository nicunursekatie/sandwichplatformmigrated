# SQL EXECUTION

Supabase client does NOT have exec_sql or raw SQL methods.

## For DDL operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)

First try Supabase client methods if possible.

If no client method exists, provide SQL for Dashboard execution.

Do not create workarounds or test scripts for simple DDL.

## Keep it simple

If adding a column fails, just say: "Run this SQL in Dashboard: [SQL]"

Do not overcomplicate with elaborate solutions.
