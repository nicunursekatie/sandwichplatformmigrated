# FIX ROOT CAUSES

Never modify scripts to work around missing columns.

If a table is missing columns, recreate it correctly.

If schema cache is stale, wait or force refresh.

Do not create elaborate workarounds for simple problems.

## Direct approach

Missing column? Add it or recreate table.
Wrong schema? Fix the schema.
Cache issue? Wait 30-60 seconds.---
