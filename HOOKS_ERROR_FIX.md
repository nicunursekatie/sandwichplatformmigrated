# React Hooks Error Fix: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"

## Problem Description

When clicking on the "Work Log" navigation item, the application was throwing a React hooks error:

```
Warning: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by wit. 
This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed.
Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was occurring in the `MessageNotifications` component during navigation transitions. The issue was caused by:

1. **Component Remounting with Unstable Props**: The `MessageNotifications` component was receiving a `user` prop that could change from `null` to an object and back during authentication state transitions.

2. **Race Conditions**: During navigation, the `useAuth` hook would temporarily return different user states, causing the component to re-render with different hook execution paths.

3. **Inconsistent Hook Execution**: The component was mounting multiple times in different authentication states, leading to hooks being called in different orders between renders.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Component Key Stabilization
Added a `key` prop to force clean remounting when user state changes:

```tsx
// Before
<MessageNotifications user={user} />

// After  
{!isLoading && <MessageNotifications key={user?.id || 'no-user'} user={user} />}
```

### 2. Loading State Guard
Prevented the component from rendering during authentication loading states:

```tsx
{!isLoading && <MessageNotifications key={user?.id || 'no-user'} user={user} />}
```

### 3. Component Memoization
Added React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

```tsx
const MessageNotifications = memo(function MessageNotifications({ user }: MessageNotificationsProps) {
  // Component implementation
});
```

### 4. User State Stability Check
Added a stability check to prevent rendering during user state transitions:

```tsx
const isUserStable = useMemo(() => {
  return user !== undefined; // user can be null (not authenticated) or object (authenticated), but not undefined
}, [user]);

// Check for stable user state first
if (!isUserStable) {
  console.log('ðŸ”” MessageNotifications: User state unstable, not rendering');
  return null;
}
```

### 5. Query Key Stabilization
Simplified the React Query key to be more predictable:

```tsx
// Before
queryKey: ['message-notifications-unread-counts', userId || 'no-user', lastCheck],

// After
queryKey: ['message-notifications-unread-counts', userId || 'no-user'],
```

## Files Modified

1. **client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx**
   - Added loading state guard
   - Added component key for stable remounting

2. **client/src/components/message-notifications.tsx**
   - Added React.memo for optimization
   - Added user state stability check
   - Simplified query key
   - Improved error handling

## Expected Outcome

These changes should eliminate the hooks error by:

1. **Preventing inconsistent renders**: The component now only renders when user state is stable
2. **Forcing clean remounts**: The key prop ensures the component is properly reset when user changes
3. **Optimizing re-renders**: Memoization reduces unnecessary updates
4. **Stabilizing queries**: Simplified query keys prevent cache invalidation issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate between different sections of the dashboard, especially to "Work Log"
2. Test authentication state changes (login/logout)
3. Verify that the MessageNotifications component displays correctly
4. Check browser console for absence of React hooks warnings

The fix addresses the root cause while maintaining the component's functionality and improving its stability during navigation and authentication state changes.
